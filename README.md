# MIDIKick
Arduino based device to convert a Roland kick drum KT-10 signal into MIDI notes 

The motivation for this project comes from a personal need: I play drums in a band and during COVID we had a fex opportunities to rehearse at one place. However, I cannot take all my drum gear with me.
Especially the my bass drum. Having a Roland kick trigger pedal KT-10 and aan Elektron Digitakt I planned to use both. But Digitakt only has a MIDI input. Hence the need for an interafce.
And I find it fun to do during this lockdown / curfew time!
